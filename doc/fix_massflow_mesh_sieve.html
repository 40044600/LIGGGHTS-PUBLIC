</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>massflow/mesh/sieve = style name of this fix command   

<LI>mesh = obligatory keyword 

<LI>mesh-ID = ID of a <A HREF = "fix_mesh_surface.html">fix mesh/surface</A> command 

<LI>point_at_outlet = obligatory keyword 

<LI>pointX pointY pointZ = vector components defining the "outside" point of the mesh 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args 

<LI>keywords = same as for <A HREF = "fix_massflow_mesh.html">fix massflow/mesh</A>, in addition: <I>sieveSize</I> and <I>sieveSpacing</I> and  <I>sieveStiffness</I>, and <I>sieveDampings</I>, or <I>sieveMultiSphereCanPass</I> 

<PRE>  <I>sieveSize</I> value = <I>x in meters</I>
    this is the diameter of the sieve opening. Used to compute the probability of sieve passage.
  <I>sieveSpacing</I> value = <I>x in meters</I>
    this is the spacing between sieve openings. Used to compute the probability of sieve passage.
  <I>sieveStiffness</I> value = <I>x in Newton per meter</I>
    value to compute the linear spring part of the normal repulsive force. WARNING: use a reasonable value to avoid popcorn!
  <I>sieveDamping</I> value = <I>x in Newton per meter/s</I>
    value to compute the dashpot part of the normal repulsive force. ARNING: use a reasonable value to avoid popcorn!
  <I>sieveMultiSphereCanPass</I>
    add this keyword to also calculate the probability of sieve passage for multisphere particles. If not set, it is impossible for multisphere particles to pass the sieve.

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is an extension of the fix "massflow/mesh", so the reader may wish to consult 
also the documentation of this fix for further details.
</P>
<P>Fix massflow/mesh/sieve models a sieve, and counts the particles that cross the sieve 
(same as in massflow/mesh). The sieve is modeled with circular holes in a the mesh (the holes 
have a certain spacing), and a passage probability is computed based on the particle diameter. 
Thus, a probability is computed based on the relative area that would result into particle passage 
divided by the total cross-sectional area of the sieve, assuming particles move perfectly normal 
to the mesh. This probability is evaluated at the first time step of every collision event, and 
compared with a uniformly-distributed random number. Thus, sliding contacts, or multiple collision 
may not by modelled accurately.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Currently, this feature does not allow deleting multi-sphere particles when crossing the sieve. 
Also, it is strongly recommended to NOT activate <I>sieveMultiSphereCanPass</I>, since this feature 
is not tested in high detail. For example, it may occur that multisphere particles may get stuck 
when passing the sieve.
