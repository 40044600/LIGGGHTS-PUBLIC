<H3>fix multisphere/break command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID multisphere/break keyword value ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>multisphere/break = style name of this fix command   

<LI>keywords = same as for <A HREF = "fix_multisphere.html">fix multisphere</A>, in addition: <I>trigger_threshold</I> and <I>trigger_timeStep</I> and  <I>trigger_fixName</I> 

<PRE>  <I>trigger_threshold</I> value = <I>x in units matching that of trigger_fixName</I>
    this allows the user the specify a threshold value that will be compared with the per-atom value provided by trigger_fixName, e.g., the residence time in a region (e.g., computed via a fix property/atom/tracer/residencetime). if the threshold is exceeded, the multisphere particle will break.
  <I>trigger_timeStep</I> value = <I>x in steps</I>
    this allows the user to activate the fix after a predefined number of steps.
  <I>trigger_fixName</I>
    the user must specify the name of the fix that specified per-atom information that is used as the trigger value. The user can freely chose the fix, allowing a flexible use of this fix.

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The integration that is performed by this command is
euqivalent to <A HREF = "fix_multisphere.html">fix_multisphere</A>. However, the user can trigger breakage events, which will destroy the "body" the atoms are in. The trigger is imiplemented such that in case the trigger value of one atom in a body exceeds the threshold value, the whole body will break. There are no fragments: all atoms that constitutea body will be released upon breakage.
</P>
<P>WARNING: the atoms in a body MUST NOT overlap, since the atoms are simply released from the body without adjusting their size or their position.
