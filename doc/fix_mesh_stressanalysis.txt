fix mesh/stressanalysis command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID mesh/stressanalysis file filename type walltype mesh_keywords values stress_keywords values :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
mesh/stressanalysis = style name of this fix command  :l
file filename type walltype mesh_keywords values are documented in "fix mesh"_fix_mesh.html. :l
zero or more stress_keyword/value pairs may be appended  :l
stress_keyword= {wear} :l
  {wear} value = {finnie} or {none} :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix cad all mesh/stressanalysis file mesh.stl type 1 finnie yes :pre

[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This command is not available in LAMMPS.

[Description:]

This fix is identical to "fix mesh"_fix_mesh.html except for the fact that the pressure and 
shear force that the particles in the fix group exert on each triangle of the mesh is 
evaluated (which costs a bit of performance).

The forces can be dumped into VTK format using the following command:

dump id group mesh/vtk N file stress :pre

which is similar to the "dump mesh/stl"_dump.html command except for the fact that a VTK 
file is written instead of an STL file which contains the STL data as well as pressure 
and shear stress. See "dump mesh/vtk"_dump.html for details.

The optional {wear} keyword can activates a simple qualitative wear model ({finnie}) - for details on the 
model, see the seperate /doc/finnie-wear.pdf. The finnie constant k in Eqn. (4.23) has to 
be specified as follows:

fix id all property/global k_finnie peratomtypepair n_atomtypes value_11 value_12 .. value_21 value_22 .. . :pre

    (value_ij=value for the finnie constant between atom type i and j; n_atomtypes is the number of atom types you want to use in your simulation) :pre

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

This fix stores a global vector with 6 components for access by various 
"output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15. The first 3 components are equal to the 
total force on the mesh, the last 3 components store the total torque on the body 
exerted by the particles. Other info see "fix mesh"_fix_mesh.html.

[Default:]

finnie = no
